Before you begin, ensure that you have set up the cloud infrastructure environment and infrastructure as code repositories. <br/>The panels on the dashboards display various metrics computed based on the security audits. The dashboard provides multiple views to analyze the non-conformance based on different categories. These views help to analyze the non-conformance from different perspectives and drill down into details."
