# Dashboard

The dashboard enables a consolidated security view of all cloud infrastructure environments and infrastructure as code repositories.

Before you begin, ensure that you have set up the cloud infrastructure environment and infrastructure as code repositories.

The panels on the dashboards display various metrics computed based on the security audits. The dashboard provides multiple views to analyze the non-conformance based on different categories. These views help to analyze the non-conformance from different perspectives and drill down into details.

The Cloud Security dashboard provides details about non-compliances based on severity and by categories such as compliance standards, cloud accounts, resource types, and risk types. 

The Code Security dashboard provides details about non-compliances based on severity and by categories such as platform and control types.
