# Introduction

**MatosSphere** secures your multi-cloud environment from build to runtime. MatosSphere is a simple, efficient and comprehensive cloud security audit tool that protects cloud infrastructure from threats and vulnerabilities and provides organizations with centralized visibility into misconfigurations. It continuously assesses, detects, manages, and remediates misconfigurations and threats in your build, deployment, and cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes).

* **Dashboard** provides a consolidated view of the entire cloud infrastructure and code repository, as well as the underlying compliance status within the account, grouped by defined categories.

* **Cloud security** auditing is the core function of the system that identifies security concerns and non-compliance of cloud assets.

* **Shift-left security** and IaC scanning make it possible to detect, identify and productively fix problems early in the development cycle.

* **Assets view** enables understanding the scope of the inventory and visualizing the relationships between assets to analyze the impact of security concerns.

* **Compliance trend** allows you to understand the improvements in the security posture over a period of time.

* **Open API** enables integration of MatosSphere into your workflows and existing applications.

* **Activity** provides the ability to monitor system events, security notifications, API access logs, and audit trails.

* **Settings** enable management of cloud infrastructure configurations, environment configurations, external application integration, and API tokens.

* **Account** settings give you full control over the application by providing configurable settings to manage organization, billing/payments, subscriptions, and users.
