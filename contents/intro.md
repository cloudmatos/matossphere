# Introduction

**MatosSphere** Secure your cloud from build to runtime. MatosSphere continuously assesses, detects, manages, and remediates misconfigurations and threats in your build, deployment, and cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes).

* **Dashboard** provides a consolidated view of the entire cloud infrastructure and code repository, as well as the underlying compliance status within the account, grouped by defined categories.

* **Assets** view enables understanding the scope of the inventory and visualizing the relationships between assets to analyze the impact of security concerns.

* **Security** auditing is the core function of the system that identifies security concerns and non-compliance of cloud assets and code repositories.

* **Activity** provides the ability to monitor system events, security notifications, API access logs, and audit trails.

* **Settings** enable management of cloud infrastructure configurations, environment configurations, external application integration, and API tokens.

* **Account** settings give you full control over the application by providing configurable settings to manage organization, billing/payments, subscriptions, and users.
