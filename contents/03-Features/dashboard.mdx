# Dashboard

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="dashboard" label="Dashboard" default>
    The dashboard enables a consolidated security view of all cloud infrastructure environments and infrastructure as code repositories. <p/>Before you begin, ensure that you have set up the cloud infrastructure environment and infrastructure as code repositories. <p/>The panels on the dashboards display various metrics computed based on the security audits. The dashboard provides multiple views to analyze the non-conformance based on different categories. These views help to analyze the non-conformance from different perspectives and drill down into details.<p/>
